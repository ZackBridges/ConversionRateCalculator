# ConversionRateCalculator
My very first js app. A calculator that calculates the conversion rate of a web page based on user input.

The latest version is written in jQuery. I realize that itâ€™s kind of pointless to use a library to cut 35 lines of code down to 15, but I did it because I could. Check the previous commits to see the original JS and how I changed it to jQuery.
